# 🥁 Drum Kit Web App

An interactive and responsive **Drum Kit Web Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
This project allows users to play different drum sounds either by clicking on the drum buttons or by pressing specific keys on the keyboard. It demonstrates real-time user interaction, DOM manipulation, event handling, and audio integration in JavaScript.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎵 Play drum sounds using mouse clicks  
- ⌨️ Keyboard support (W A S D J K L)  
- ⚡ Instant sound response  
- ✨ Button press animation effect  
- 🎧 Integrated realistic drum audio  
- 📱 Clean and responsive UI design

## 🎮 How It Works

- Each drum button is mapped to a specific sound file.
- JavaScript listens for:
  - `click` events
  - `keypress` events
- When a valid key is pressed:
  - The corresponding drum sound plays.
  - A temporary animation effect is applied to the button.
- The sound is triggered using the JavaScript `Audio()` object.
